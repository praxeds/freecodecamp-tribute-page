                In a time when lobotomies, electroshock and insulin therapies werestill the norm in Brazilian
                psychiatry, Nise da Silveira stood outas a singular voice advocating for a kinder and more
                relationalapproach to the treatment of people with mental health conditions.Despite working in an arena
                dominated by men, she foughtpassionately against the status quo and was instrumental inestablishing
                occupational therapies as a valid treatment inschizophrenia and other chronic psychiatric conditions in
                Brazil,changing the way in which rehabilitation was viewed and practisedin her native land.

                Inspired by the work of R.D. Laing, David Cooper and Maxwell
                Jones, she set out to develop new and more compassionate ways of
                working with those suffering with chronic illness. This led to her
                establishing the Seção de Terapêutica Ocupacional e Rehabilitação
                (Department of Occupational Therapy and Rehabilitation) in the
                Centro Psiquiátrico de Pedro II, Rio de Janeiro, in 1946. Here,
                she organised workshops for painting and sculpting where patients
                were encouraged to experiment with new means of emotional
                expression. A devotee of Carl Gustav Jung, da Silveira applied
                Jungian ideas to the interpretation of her patients' works in an
                attempt to develop a deeper and more personal understanding of the
                individuals in her care and the psychotic processes underpinning
                their symptoms. The success of this approach was evident early on
                and many of da Silveira's patients were able to successfully
                reintegrate back into society.

                The works of these patients eventually came to be celebrated in the Museu de Imagens do Inconsciente
                (Museum of Images of the Unconscious) which da Silveira founded in 1952. The museum has remained in
                operation to this day and now holds over 350 000 works by patients from the 1940s to today.

                da Silveira went on to establish the Casa das Palmeiras in 1956, a clinic devoted to the rehabilitation
                of former patients of psychiatric hospitals which eschewed the institutionalisation and restriction of
                liberty of its attendees. She pioneered research into the therapeutic potential of animals in recovery,
                naming them her 'co-therapists', and her work inspired the creation of cultural centres and therapeutic
                institutions both in Brazil and abroad. She died at the age of 94, leaving behind a truly unique legacy.
                Her passion and devotion to the value of emotional connection, creativity and compassion are reminders
                of the importance of these qualities in both the treatment and rehabilitation of people with mental
                illness.
